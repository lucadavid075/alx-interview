# LOCK BOXES

## Problem Description
You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to `n - 1`, and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. You need to write a method to determine if all the boxes can be opened.

## Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    pass
```

## Input
- `boxes`: A list of lists representing the boxes and their corresponding keys.
    - Each inner list represents a box.
    - The index of the inner list represents the box number.
    - The elements in the inner list represent the keys contained within that box.
    - Keys are positive integers.
    - There can be keys that do not have boxes.

## Output
- Returns `True` if all boxes can be opened, indicating that every box can be unlocked using the available keys.
- Returns `False` if it is not possible to open all boxes, indicating that there is at least one box that cannot be unlocked.

## Constraints
- The number of boxes `n` is a positive integer.
- The number of keys in each box is arbitrary.

## Examples
```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))
# Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))
# Output: True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))
# Output: False
```

## Explanation
- In the first example, all boxes can be opened. Starting with the first box, we have the keys to open all subsequent boxes.
- In the second example, all boxes can be opened. By following the key-chain, we can open all the boxes.
- In the third example, not all boxes can be opened. There is no way to obtain the key for box number 3, so it remains locked.

## Solving using the UMPIRE Method
To solve the LOCK BOXES problem, we can follow the UMPIRE method:

- **Understand**: Read and understand the problem description. Clarify any doubts or ambiguities.
- **Match**: Identify similar problems you have encountered before or related concepts you are familiar with.
- **Plan**: Plan a solution for the problem, considering the requirements and constraints.
- **Implement**: Translate your solution plan into code.
- **Review**: Test your code implementation and review for any errors or optimizations.
- **Evaluate**: Analyze the efficiency and correctness of your code.

## Problem Analysis
- **Understand**: We are given a list of boxes, each containing keys to other boxes. We need to determine if it is possible to open all the boxes by following the key-chain.
- **Match**: This problem can be matched with graph traversal algorithms, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), to explore the connectivity between boxes and determine if all boxes can be opened. The problem involves traversing a graph of boxes and keys: We can represent the boxes and keys as nodes and edges of a directed graph, respectively. DFS is a suitable algorithm for exploring graphs and determining if all nodes can be visited.
- **Plan**: We can use a DFS approach to traverse the boxes and check if all boxes can be reached. We will keep track of the visited boxes to avoid revisiting them. Starting from the first box, we will recursively explore each box's keys and mark the visited boxes. If, after the traversal, all boxes are visited, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.
- Initialize a visited list to track the visited state of each box: We create a list to keep track of the visited status of each box during the traversal.
- Mark the first box as visited: We start the traversal from the first box and mark it as visited.
- Use DFS to traverse the graph, visiting boxes based on available keys: We apply DFS to explore the graph, moving from one box to another based on the keys available at each box.
- Check if all boxes have been visited: After the traversal, we check if all boxes have been marked as visited. If so, it means all boxes can be opened.
- **Implement**: Implement the `canUnlockAll` function according to the planned approach.
- **Review**: Test the function with various test cases to ensure it returns the correct results and handles different scenarios properly.
- **Evaluate**: Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution. Consider any edge cases or optimizations that can be made.
